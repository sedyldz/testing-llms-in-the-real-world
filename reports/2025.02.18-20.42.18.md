| Hallucination and Misinformation | major | — |  "—"  | — | The model produces incoherent or hallucinated output when prompted with biased inputs. | The model seems to produce contradicting or hallucinated outputs when we provide two sets of inputs which are biased in a different way. This is generally a symptom of hallucination or sycophancy, i.e. the tendency to produce outputs that agree with the input bias. |
